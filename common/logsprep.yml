### Description ###
# This taskbook helps standarize the way we setup the log directories. It is meant to be included in a playbooks pre_tasks.
# Currently set to store playbook logs inside your ~/ansibleLogs directory.
# Requires the {{DIR}} variable to be passed on inclusion for the name of the log directory to prepend.

### Usage ###
## Add the following block import in the pre_tasks of your playbook
#
#  - block: # We use block so that we can apply the 'always' tag to all included tasks.
#   # The DATE_TIME variable is set in here
#    - name: Prepare Log Dir
#      include_tasks: ../common/logsprep.yml # Assuming you have the common/ subdir in your parent dir. If not, amend this accordingly.
#      vars:
#        DIR: "YOUR_PLAY_NAME" # Replace "YOUR_PLAY_NAME" with the string you want to prepend in from of the date of your log directory.
#    tags: always
#
## You should now now use "~/ansibleLogs/YOUR_PLAY_NAME-{{DATE_TIME.stdout}}/" in the rest of your playbook as the path you save logfiles into.

- name: Gather date and time
  # We have to use the unix date command because it's not possible to set a variable within a taskbook.
  # So this way we can use the register to set the variable we need. Unfortunately we still need to keep using .stdout.
  # We don't use the internal ansible date/time variables as these are based on each host and the minute can change if the tasks gathering takes too long.
  command: date +%Y-%M-%d_%H%M 
  register: DATE_TIME
