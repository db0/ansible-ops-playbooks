# This taskbook helps standarize the way we setup the log directories. It is meant to be included in a playbooks pre_tasks.
# Currently set to store playbook logs inside your ~/ansibleLogs directory.
# Requires the {{DIR}} variable to be passed on inclusion for the name of the log directory to prepend.

- name: Gather date and time
  # We have to use the unix date command because it's not possible to set a variable within a taskbook.
  # So this way we can use the register to set the variable we need. Unfortunately we still need to keep using .stdout.
  # We don't use the internal ansible date/time variables as these are based on each host and the minute can change if the tasks gathering takes too long.
